<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>ith the digitalisation drive in Malaysia, the Government is encouraging the use of information technology to improve health-care by reducing costs and improving outcomes. In Malaysia, there is an ever-growing ageing patient population with chronic diseases such as wounds. Diabetes is on the rise, with 17.5% of the population having this debilitating disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In addition, 25% of these patients develop chronic wound complications. Increased monitoring to assist in identifying complications, customising local wound care treatments and adherence is required. There are many challenges in wound care, including: the lack of standardisation of consolidated wound data, such as a central wound documentation repository where clinicians can readily access well-presented patient wound records; and the high costs of treating wound complications resulting from lack of proper monitoring and fragmented efforts (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>) .</p><p>The wound care unit in Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) recognised the need for efficient monitoring of patients' wounds and was approached by the NDKare smart wound management solution development team to evaluate the use of such an application in a wound care centre setting. This application is a smartphone-based point-of-care system that will enable collaboration between medical disciplines, which aims to improve health outcomes, reduce costs and enhance patient experience (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> A study has reported that it is an intuitive, secure, collaborative, cost-effective and stable wound care management system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> It requires a mobile smartphone, installed with the app, with an internet or 4G connection and is available on Android and iOS platform. In addition, it has an effective longitudinal wound report that meets legal and regulatory requirements and thae dashboard that allows clinicians to automatically generate longitudinal wound reports. The smartphone app is a commercially available product. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> A two year study (2015-2017), by the Home Nursing Foundation, Singapore, had more than four months' of quantitative data with a wide patient profile showing the reliability and the validity of using this application in patients with wounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim</head><p>The aim of this study was to determine the productivity increase using digital imagery for better documentation and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods</head><p>The clinical evaluation of the digital application was done at the Wound Care Unit, Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL)</p><p>Objective: The primary aim was to determine the productivity increase using digital imagery for better documentation and analysis. A case series was done in a specialised care centre with patients managed with advanced dressings and using state-of-the-art smartphone technology for documentation to save costs and time. Method: Wounds were cleansed and debrided before using the application to photograph, document, measure and analyse the wounds. The smartphone app was oriented parallel to the plane of the wound, where possible, to obtain accurate measurements. A longitudinal study report was generated for each wound and showed the progress of the wound healing until the wound was closed. Results: A sample size of 60 patients consisting of wounds from different locations, and a total of 203 measurements and analyses were conducted over a period of seven months. The wound monitoring app proved to be effective for wound monitoring and required less than two hours' training. A report summary of wounds recorded could also be generated automatically through the dashboard. All 60 patients' cases were automatically recorded, measured and presented into reports for use in clinical analysis. There was a significant time savings (27 hours per day for a specialised care centre with 10 nurses) increase over manual wound documentation and measuring methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The app provided a non-contact, easy to use, reliable and accurate smart wound management solution for clinicians and physicians to track wound healing in patients. The app could also be used by patients and caregivers for home monitoring of their wounds. Declaration of interest: The author has no conflicts of interest.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">cost • digital imagery • documentation • productivity • smartphone • time</formula><p>Increasing productivity with smartphone digital imagery wound measurements and analysis from January to July 2018 (seven months). Patients were chosen from the population of HKL's wound care unit. Patients that satisfied the inclusion criteria were selected randomly to remove bias from the study. A wound care nurse was assigned to a specified patient, and the same nurse took all the measurements throughout the study to avoid any inconsistencies in use and interpretation of the app. There were three nurses involved in the study and patients fitting inclusion criteria and taken care of by any of the three nurses were enrolled Training for using the smartphone app was conducted by the company's development team for nurses at the Wound Care Unit at HKL. The nurses were trained to take a single photo of the wound and a video of the wound with the smartphone camera at a fixed distance and at different angles. Proficiency was determined by ensuring the nurses were able to use the app to measure and document the wound effectively. The nurses were able to learn how to use it within two hours.</p><p>The basic procedure was that the wound care nurse removed the bandage and cleaned the wound thoroughly, including debridement, before the app was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement and documentation</head><p>The following protocol was followed:</p><p>• Ensure that the patient is comfortably positioned in the anatomically correct position • Position the marker in the same plane of the wound • Position the camera apparatus at a standard distance of approximately 5cm from the wound • Take the photo at a consistent perpendicular angle of the wound • Take one video of the wound at fixed distance and at different angles The measurements and photos were stored securely and encrypted on a server maintained and protected by the service provider. Measurements are recorded in the database. Area measurements based on actual area (based on perimeter for the wound) and the area based on length x width were compared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion criteria</head><p>• External wounds • Patients with wound length &lt;20cm and width &lt;20cm • Age (to follow the patient distribution of HKL)</p><p>• Gender (to follow the patient distribution of HKL)</p><p>• Race (to follow the patient distribution of HKL)</p><p>• Number of wounds on the patient (no limit).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusion criteria</head><p>• Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin • Wounds with significant curvature where the marker cannot be placed on the same plane as the wound. Non-blanchable erythemas were excluded as they appear only as redness on the skin e.g. category 1 pressure ulcers.</p><p>The outcome measure was to examine if the time and cost savings in the measurement and documentation of wound could be obtained by using the app.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We recruited 60 patients with a variety of wounds, including DFUs and PUs, from different locations and a total of 203 measurements and analyses were conducted over a period of seven months. Here we present a selection of cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 1: diabetic foot ulcer (right foot)</head><p>A 92-year-old male with a DFU of the right foot of approximately five months' duration. Comorbidities included chronic venous ulcer and stasis eczema. The wound was treated with stimulen gel (South West Technologies) with PolyMem Pink (PolyMem). Using the app, actual wound area decreased from an initial size of 5.7cm 2 to closure of the wound. The area calculated based on length and width measurements decreased from 7.9cm 2 to closure of the wound (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 2: diabetic foot ulcer (left foot)</head><p>A 71-year-old male with a DFU of the left foot. The patient had diabetes. The wound was treated with stimulen gel. Using the app, the actual wound area decreased from 7.8cm 2 to closure recorded over approximately 2 months. The area calculated on length and width measurements decreased from 10.8cm 2 to closure (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). practice</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">J O U R N A L O F W O U N D C A R E G W C S U P P L E M E N T, V O L 2 7 , N O 9 , S E P T E M B E R 2 0 1 8 S 1 5</formula><p>BETAplast N (Mundipharma) and barrier cream.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 3</head><p>A 41-year-old female with a wound on the right thigh.</p><p>Comorbidities included diabetes and psoriasis anaemia.</p><p>The wound was treated with MediHoney (Derma Sciences), L-Mesitran Tulle (Mesitran Netherlands),  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">J O U R N A L O F W O U N D C A R E G W C S U P P L E M E N T, V O L 2 7 , N O 9 , S E P T E M B E R 2 0 1 8 S 1 6</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimated productivity increase and cost savings</head><p>Clinician compensation was based on the average pay of a nurse in Malaysia, estimated at RM3000 Malaysia Ringgit (approximately US$730, £570) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The same computation can be adapted to different scenarios and for different countries currencies. This also assumed that each nurse would receive a bonus of one month's pay at the end of the year. There was also no overtime  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Full measurement (length, width, area, perimeter, depth and volume) and documentation of the patient's wound was estimated to take 30 minutes. Using the smartphone app, the time taken to measure the wound, was estimated to be at most five minutes.</p><p>Giving a manpower cost saving per wound measurement of RM8.53 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>)</p><p>At the specialised wound care unit at HKL, there are a total of 10 nurses and the number of patients visiting the centre averages 65 patients per day. Based on this the total cost savings per annum were estimated to be RM133,140.76 based on 20 working days per month 12 months a year (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) Each nurse undertook the following processing starting with registering the patient, preparing the patient, assessing the patient, cleaning the wound, measuring/documenting the wound, treating and bandaging the wound.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a b c d practice J O U R N A L O F W O U N D C A R E G W C S U P P L E M E N T, V O L 2 7 , N O 9 , S E P T E M B E R 2 0 1 8 S 1 8</formula><p>The savings estimated only considers the time savings for nursing staff. There will be further savings for other office staff, such as registration receptionists and assistants that is not included in this calculation.   Due to the time savings, it was possible for the wound care unit to perform up to 325 wound measurements and documentations per day in the specialised care centre, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the Wound Care Unit, Dept of Internal Medicine, the use of a manual ruler or wound tracing has been a wellestablished norm due to the low cost and ease of use. However, there are reliability and accuracy issues with this technique. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted with the smartphone application over a two-month period which showed the practicality and ease of use of this application in the overall management of the wounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> The smartphone application has proven to have validity in accuracy for length, width, area and perimeter. From the clinicians' perspective, there are time savings, productivity savings of 500%, ease of use, seamless trending of wound progress into the electronic medical record and, last but not least, better photographic clarity to facilitate multidisciplinary discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study only assessed the use of the app to measure wounds; this was not compared with traditional methods for comparative analysis. Furthermore, the time taken for measurement was an estimation based on our experience rather than actual timing, although we believe these are consistent in our experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The non-invasive nature of this application also improved quality and consistency with, a reduction in errors in clinical wound-care documentation. Adoption of this solution would reduce costs and improve workflow. Applications such as this are beneficial in terms of better financial management, ability to track return on investment and variable costs, and as a collaborative mobile platform whereby there is remote accessibility and ease of collaboration between disciplines.
