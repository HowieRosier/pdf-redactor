<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical practice</head><p>comorbidities that affect healing potential, including diabetes, cardiac disease and obesity, these costs will inevitably rise unless wound care becomes more efficient and effective. To overcome these increases in demand and case complexity, a change in service management is required to reduce healing times and improve outcomes, including levels of wound recurrence. However, in today's financially challenged health systems, much emphasis is directed to dressing procurement and unit costs, rather than the total cost for an episode of care and subsequent outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> .</p><p>Guest and Vowden <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> highlight the false economy of reducing dressing cost and agree that a review of the delivery of wound care service with an emphasis on wound diagnosis and early, appropriate treatment would be a more effective method of reducing overall cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cost drivers in wound management</head><p>To allow for efficient wound management, it is important to address factors that influence the economic and human costs of wound management. The cost of dressings, devices and diagnostic equipment is accepted, but another important economic driver is healthcare professional time, impacted notably by duration of care, occurrence of complications, and dressing change frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> .</p><p>According to a recent freedom of information request, the cost of a hospital stay is estimated to be £400 per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> , with studies showing that W ound healing is a complex cascade of events that occurs in a recognised sequence and time frame. This intricate process can be interrupted by numerous patient-, wound-, comorbidity-, biophysiological-or care-related factors, all of which can delay or prevent wound healing. Early recognition and appropriate corrective treatment is necessary as delayed treatment affects healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> , resulting in increased burden to patients, society and the economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hard-to-heal wounds: the financial challenges</head><p>In 2009, the management of chronic wounds was estimated to cost the NHS between £2.5bn and £3.1bn per annum, accounting for 3% to 4% of the healthcare budget <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . A further analysis of NHS wound care costs in 2012/2013, estimated the cost of wound care and associated comorbidities for acute and chronic wounds was between £4.5bn and £5.1bn per annum. Some £3.2bn went on treating the 40% of wounds with delayed healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> . Furthermore, Fife et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> estimated the cost of wound care in the US was approximately $50bn per annum, representing 5% of the total annual spend on both Medicare and Medicaid, combined with $25bn spent annually on the treatment of chronic wounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> .</p><p>Since the prevalence and incidence of wounds are likely to increase with the ageing population, and given the predicted rise in The economic impact of hard-toheal wounds: promoting practice change to address passivity in wound management</p><p>As the prevalence and incidence of wounds are predicted to increase due to an ageing population with increasing comorbidities, reducing the burden of wounds by optimising healing is seen as a key factor in lowering wound care costs. Inappropriate or delayed treatment adversely affects the time to wound healing, impacting quality of life, and increasing the burden on patients, their families and carers, society and the health economy. Identifying non-healing wounds is vital to cost reduction. Failure to recognise wounds not progressing towards healing increases the subsequent risk of non-healing and places the patient at unnecessary increased risk of wound complications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Authors: Professor Peter Vowden Kathryn Vowden</head><p>Clinical practice wounds of more than 6 months' duration are at a greater risk of admission or extended hospital stay compared with wounds of a shorter duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . Within the normal parameters of acute wound healing, re-epitheliasation should be reached within 4 weeks. When healing is delayed, which can occur for numerous reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> , a wound can become chronic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</p><p>Chronic wounds can be difficult to treat and are costly to healthcare systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> , requiring a lengthened period of care, with increased patient dependency and risk of developing complications; infection, for example, can incur intensive or specialist treatments, long hospital stays, and a high number of readmissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> .</p><p>Secondary care interventions may also be necessary to treat the underlying cause of a wound and so reduce healing times and likelihood of recurrence, e.g. management of venous disease as part of the treatment of venous ulceration <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . Guest et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> reported that the community bares 66% of the total annual NHS cost of caring for patients with wounds and associated comorbidities. The distribution of costs varied according to wound type, with 48% of costs for acute wounds incurred in the community, compared with 78% for chronic wounds. Another survey of 1,735 patients with acute and chronic wounds from UK region revealed 32% of patients were treated in acute care as an inpatient or outpatient <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> .</p><p>These studies indicate that healthcare professionals working in all care environments manage patients with acute and chronic wounds, and should therefore be competent in the fundamentals of wound management and aware of current guidance on different wound types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chronicity and cost of wound management across wound types</head><p>Evidence exists across wound types demonstrating the impact of chronicity on costs. Dealey et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> suggest the estimated cost of healing a grade 4 pressure ulcer is 10 times more than for a grade 1 ulcer, while Bennett et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> found that grade 4 pressure ulcers with complications were more expensive to heal than those without complications (£9,670 vs. £7,750). Costs increase as the time to heal is greater and incidence of complications higher.</p><p>Guest et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> have estimated that the NHS treated 278,000 leg ulcers in 2012-2013 at a cost per patient of between £788 (healed) and £4,472 (unhealed) to manage the wound and associated morbidities. In the US, incremental medical costs associated with VLUs were estimated to be between $6,391-$7,086; in addition, patients with VLUs missed more time from work than matched controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> . Moreover, only about 50% of VLUs will heal within 4 months, 20% will have not healed within 2 years, and approximately 8% have not healed after 5 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</p><p>For DFUs, the equivalent cost has been estimated to be $10,604 (range $1,444-$85,718) [20]   . In Canada, average 3-year cumulative cost for DFUs was estimated at C$52,360 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> , 50% of DFUs will become infected and approximately 25% of these patients require either a minor or major lower limb amputation. As such, once ulceration has occurred, it is vital to aim for quick healing to reduce the risk of infection and the associated increased likelihood of amputation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The economic impact of inappropriate care</head><p>Various challenges increase the difficulty of efficacious and cost-effective wound treatment; notable is a lack of awareness of the complexity of wound management beyond the choice of dressing. Studies have shown that 26% of patients with leg or foot ulcers have no definite diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> , many patients with foot ulcers have not undergone investigations to determine wound aetiology, and 50%-60% of patients with VLUs have not been treated with compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> . Similar findings were reported by Vowden and Vowden <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> , with lack of full assessment (Doppler) or diagnosis for many patients, and some inappropriate treatment selections.</p><p>The Burden of Wounds Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> showed that despite published guidelines and Best Practice statements [Table <ref type="table">1</ref>] many of these deficiencies continue in current practice, with 30% of wounds lacking a differential diagnosis and only 16% of cases with leg or foot ulceration having a Doppler ankle brachial pressure index recorded. Lack of best practice implementation is a substantial contributor to wound care burden, as more and more wounds stall during the healing process. As such, it is vital not only that interventions are effective in terms of improving outcomes, but also that patients and clinicians understand, and are willing and able to adhere to appropriate protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> .</p><p>The guidelines in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> emphasise the importance of careful and repeated wound assessment, including wound measurement and documentation as part of care delivery. It is only by doing so, and auditing outcomes Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Selection of available guidelines and best practice statements relevant to wound management <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guideline/organisation</head><p>Guidelines with reference to wound management carefully, that wounds failing to heal can be identified. Indications are that wounds likely to have a slow or non-healing trajectory can be predicted as early as the second to fourth week of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> , allowing early care plan revision and possible introduction of alternative, advanced therapies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human cost of living with a wound</head><p>The economic evidence is becoming increasingly compelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , but there is also a human cost of living with a wound. Wounds impact patients' physical, mental and social wellbeing, and adversely affect families and carers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> . While outcomes are most often measured in terms of wound progress, patients may have different priorities, such as: ■ reduction in pain or malodour, ■ reduction in exudate levels, and ■ comfort and appearance of the wound or dressings used <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> .</p><p>For younger patients, a wound may impact work and income, while for all patients there are a range of issues that adversely impact daily living, with pain, exudate, odour, mobility and sleep all identified as challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> . These issues are multiplied by wound chronicity and fear of recurrence, and are associated with both anxiety and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of advanced wound dressings</head><p>Restructure of care methods, including consideration of advanced technologies, is needed to address these issues. The introduction of biotechnologies and advanced wound care products into the care pathway can be challenging within a tight budget, due to the perceived high unit cost. However, payers and decision-makers should take the total cost of care into account when deciding upon appropriate allocation of their financial resources and the inclusion of these products within formulary, not just unit costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> .</p><p>The longer a wound is left without appropriate treatment, the more likely it is to stall during healing, increasing the cost burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> , but the potential to release resources by utilising more effective wound care pathways compared with standard care is often overlooked <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . There is a need to increase understanding of why wounds become hard-to-heal in order to inform and target treatment protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</p><p>The definition of 'advanced wound care therapy' covers interventions used when standard wound care has failed. The existing selection of advanced therapies is large and growing, with a variety of interventions available for different indications <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> . Indeed, although advanced treatments are often more expensive per unit, it can make sense in terms of overall economic and clinical outcome to use these products where standard care has not achieved the intended outcome.</p><p>Choosing an advanced wound care therapy could lead to earlier control of symptoms, promotion of wound closure, improved patient wellbeing and quality of life and, ultimately, reduced cost burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . Increasing understanding of the barriers to healing and development of cost-effective diagnostics will further assist product choice and improve the economic argument for use of these products <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Wound care is an expensive, labour intensive, but necessary element of healthcare provision, accounting for up to 4% of the healthcare budget, much of which is directed towards management of wounds in the community. Inevitably, there are pressures to reduce costs and, currently, these are largely procurement driven. Such an emphasis may reduce costs initially but fails to address the more important issues of service delivery and enhanced patient outcomes. Accurate assessment and careful monitoring of healing progress are vital to address the patient, society and healthcare costs of delayed wound healing; only this way can appropriate, individualised wound management plans be developed, advanced wound care products be used effectively, and long-term costs be reduced.</p></div>
