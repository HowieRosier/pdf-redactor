<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Patients with diabetes mellitus have a lifetime risk of 15% to 25% of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). DFU is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Wound imaging systems are useful adjuncts in monitoring of wound progress. Our study aims to review existing literature on the available wound assessment and monitoring systems for DFU. This is a systematic review of articles from PubMed and Embase (1974 -March 2020). All studies related to wound assessment or monitoring systems in DFUs were included. Articles on other types of wounds, review articles, and non-English texts were excluded.</p><p>Outcomes include clinical use, wound measurement statistics, hospital system integration, and other advantages and challenges. The search identified 531 articles. Seventeen full-text studies were eligible for the final analysis. Five modalities were identified: (a) computer applications or hand-held devices (n = 5), (b) mobile applications (n = 2), (c) optical imaging (n = 2), (d) spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging (n = 4), and (e) artificial intelligence (n = 4). Most studies (n = 16) reported on wound assessment or monitoring.</p><p>Only one study reported on data capturing. Two studies on the use of computer applications reported low inter-observer variability in wound measurement (inter-rater reliability &gt;0.99, and inter-observer variability 15.9% respectively). Hand-held commercial devices demonstrated high accuracy (relative error of 2.1%-6.8%). Use of spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging in prediction of wound healing has a sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 90% and 74%to 86%, respectively. Majority of the commercially available wound assessment systems have not been reviewed in the literature on measurement accuracy. In conclusion, most imaging systems are superior to traditional wound assessment. Wound imaging systems should be used as adjuncts in DFU monitoring.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) has plagued approximately 425 million people worldwide, with an annual incidence of 6.7 to 7 per 1000 per year in developed countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Patients with DM are at risk of developing foot ulceration with a lifetime risk of 15% to 25%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Several risk factors have been identified for the development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs): vascular disease, neuropathy, and foot deformity; all of which, are long-term sequelae of poorly controlled DM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> DFU is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a 2.5 times higher risk of 5-year mortality as compared to diabetic patients without DFU. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Patients with DFU also have to bear the high socioeconomic burden associated with the complications and management of DFUs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Due to the high prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality, it is prudent to ensure proper management of DFUs. Wound care is an important aspect of DFU management. It is a complex process involving a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals, and is a spectrum ranging from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> wound assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> documentation and monitoring, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> intercommunication different various healthcare professionals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> This unmet need for proper wound care gave rise to the innovation of comprehensive wound assessment or monitoring systems.</p><p>To date, there are several commercially available wound assessment or monitoring systems available for monitoring of chronic wounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Wound assessments or monitoring systems range from the use of traditional computer applications and imaging devices to the use of mobile applications for remote assessment; all of which with potential for integration with artificial intelligence to improve measurement outcomes. Features of an ideal imaging system would include high accuracy, portability, convenience, accessibility (integration into existing hospital records and ability for remote assessment) data security, and low costs. However, to our knowledge, only a small proportion of those products are assessed in existing literature. With advancement in technology and rise in commercially available product, a systematic review is ideal to summarise existing evidence on various wound imaging systems available for use in DFU. Our study aims to fill in the gap and summarise various types of wound assessment and monitoring systems in DFUs in existing literature. Our secondary aim is to identify the list of commercially available systems used in DFU monitoring and examine available evidence on their use.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Data sources and searches</head><p>This is a systematic review on use of wound assessment, imaging, and monitoring systems in DFU. A systematic search of published articles in peer-reviewed journals was performed on PubMed and Embase (1974-March 2020). The last search was performed on March 30, 2020. A combination of subject headings and text words on (a) diabetic foot ulcer and (b) multimodal imaging, optical imaging, spectral imaging, computer-assisted interpretation, artificial intelligence, or mobile applications were used in the search. The complete search strategy is appended in the Appendices (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">S1,</ref><ref type="table">S2</ref>). Studies selected for the systematic review are in accordance to the quality and standards set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Study selection</head><p>Inclusion criteria were: (a) description, (b) measurement accuracy, or (c) clinical use or challenges of imaging systems, technology, applications, or software in wound assessment of diabetic foot ulcers. Exclusion criteria were: (a) other types of wound such as pressure ulcers, (b) conventional radiological imaging such as plain radiograph, ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, (c) review articles, letter to editors or editorials, (d) non-English articles or (e) articles without full texts.</p><p>Two authors (KSC, ZJL) independently screened the studies by title and abstract for potential inclusion in the Key Messages</p><p>• wound imaging systems are useful adjuncts in monitoring of diabetes foot ulcers (DFUs) • majority of hand-held applications, computer applications, spectroscopy, and artificial intelligence report high accuracy in wound measurement. however, majority of the commercially available wound assessment systems have not been reviewed in the literature on measurement accuracy study. Full-texts of all eligible articles were subsequently reviewed and assessed for eligibility in the study. Disagreement or conflicts between reviewers were resolved by consensus. The entire study selection process is reflected in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">| Data extraction and quality assessment</head><p>Two independent authors (KSC, ZJL) extracted the following information from each study separately: Author, F I G U R E 1 Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) figure showing the study selection process year of study, type of wound assessed, name of system, clinical use, parameters of wound assessed, measurement statistics, ability to integrate into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) or Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) other advantages and challenges. Quality of the included studies were assessed with the revised Methodological Index for Non-Randomised Studies (MINORS) criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). Descriptive studies and technical reports on the use of artificial intelligence were not included in the quality assessment as the use of MINORS criteria is not validated for these types of studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">| Secondary literature search</head><p>A secondary literature search was performed on WoundSource, 8 a reference guide on wound care products, for a list of commercially available wound assessment and monitoring tools available for DFU. The following information was extracted: description, platform, method of measurement, type of measurement, ability for EHR or EMR integration, remote assessment, and other features. The products were subsequently searched on PubMed for available literature on the respective products.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">| Wound assessment and monitoring systems available commercially</head><p>A total of 18 commercially available wound assessment and monitoring systems were listed on WoundSource. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Table <ref type="table">3</ref> summarises the characteristics of these products. Of these 18 products, only 6 of the products were described on their efficacy or accuracy in wound measurements in PubMed indexed peer-reviewed articles. Sil-houetteMobile was the only product which was described in our systematic review, including articles by Foltynski et al and Rogers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> The use of the remaining five products described in peer-reviewed literature was on general wound measurement without the inclusion of diabetic foot ulcers and were hence excluded from this systematic review. The relevant articles on measurement accuracy of the products, are however, referenced and listed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">| Quality of included studies</head><p>The quality of included studies was analysed using the MINORS criteria (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). Of the six studies which were non-comparative, five obtained a score of 12 or less, which reflects high risk of bias. Of the six studies which were comparative, four studies obtained a score of 20 or less, which also reflects a high risk of bias. Diabetic foot ulcer is an important complication of diabetes and warrants close monitoring for prevention, promoting wound healing, and preventing recurrence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Several classification systems have been developed to risk stratify and predict the prognosis of DFUs, and its subsequent management. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> However, it is prudent to perform proper wound care on all patients with DFUs regardless of its severity. Our study analysed the various modalities of wound assessment to aid clinicians and allied health professionals in the management of DFUs. Wound care begins with wound assessment, which involves the accurate measurement of parameters such as wound area, depth, volume, stage, signs of infection, and healing potential. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Majority (94.1%) of the included studies centred around wound assessment and documented the efficacy of various systems in the accuracy and precision of measurements in DFUs. The use of computer software and hand-held devices has seen optimistic results. Jeffcoate et al and Rajbhandari et al reported low interobserver variability in the use of computer applications in digital measurements of wound area (inter-rater reliability &gt;0.99, and inter-observer variability 15.9%, respectively). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> This is of special significance in the monitoring of DFUs as the management of DFU involves a multidisciplinary team. It is paramount for low inter-observer variability for precise documentation to track the wound progression or healing and institute proper management.</p><p>Spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging are alternative methods of non-invasive monitoring which assess the oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration in the wound bed through the use of diffuse photon wave density (650-850 nm) to differentiate healing wounds from non-healing wounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Of the four studies included in this analysis, Weingarten et al and Nouvong et al demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 90% and 74% to 86%, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Prediction of wound healing is an important aspect of DFU assessment: Sheehan et al demonstrated that in patients with DFUs who did not achieve a 50% reduction in wound area by 4 weeks were unlikely to heal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> Further treatment in this subgroup of patients may be ineffective and may be discontinued. Weingarten et al demonstrated an average cost saving of about $12 600 per patient if ineffective treatment was discontinued for ulcers with low likelihood of healing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> In the era of digitalisation, there is a transition from traditional documentation on paper to digital documentation to improve patient care. Digital photographs of DFUs are uploaded to hospital EHRs or EMRs for (a) wound monitoring (b) comanagement in a multidisciplinary team. Laji et al first described the use of a relatively inexpensive and easy to use software for the creation of a digital imaging archive system to track wound progression, with possible integration into EHRs or EMRs (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> To date, there are several commercially available systems have an integrated system of wound assessment, monitoring, and documentation for easy use (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). However, majority of those systems (n = 12/18, 66.7%) have not been reviewed in the literature on its accuracy in wound measurement. It is prudent for future studies to review these systems in terms of (a) measurement accuracy (b) ease of use (c) data integration capabilities (d) remote assessment capabilities (e) costs and (f) other challenges to guide clinicians and allied health professionals on the choice of the better "all-in-one" integrated system for wound care in DFU.</p><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is a rapidly growing field, especially in radiology and oncology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> However, there are an increasing number of studies on the use of AI in other areas of medicine, such as vascular medicine or surgery. Four articles included in our study examined the use of various AI systems in wound assessment, all of which, were dated less than 5 years ago. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Wang et al and Ohura et al demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity in wound recognition and assessment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Goyal et al further demonstrated the use of AI to recognise ischemia and infection in DFU monitoring, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> a challenge which has been described in the remote assessment of DFUs. Van Netten et al studied the reliability of remote assessment of DFUs using mobile phone images which failed to demonstrate strong validity or adequate reliability in assessing ischemia and infection in DFUs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> AI may be used to increase the reliability of remote assessment of DFU images and will serve as a useful adjunct in comanagement of DFUs.</p><p>Last, our study reflects the difficulty in conducting studies to evaluate wound assessments and monitoring systems. Majority of the studies analysed using the MINORS criteria had high risk of bias, where studies did not have a blind or double-blind evaluation of objective or subjective endpoints, respectively. Sample size calculation was also not performed for majority of the studies, contributing to bias. This observation may be explained by the paucity of existing studies evaluating the efficacy of wound assessment and imaging systems and its emerging role as clinical adjuncts. However, this review provides an extensive overview of the available evidence on the various wound assessment and imaging systems to guide future studies and their methodologies in the evaluation of new commercially available systems. Nevertheless, it is also prudent to note that the use of MINORS criteria has its limitations 10 ; the criteria was originally developed to assess the risk of bias in observational surgical studies and its validation in other types of studies is limited.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. Our search was limited to diabetic foot ulcers. We did not expand our search to include other types of wounds such as pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, or burns as the search would be too extensive and would not be the aim of this study. Characteristics of DFUs differ from other types of chronic wounds. Nevertheless, we agree that the type of wound is unlikely to affect the measurement accuracy of wound parameters. Another limitation of this study is the restriction of our literature search to two databases due to limited subscription to research databases. Our literature search on the types of commercially available wound care products is also limited to WoundSource; however, WoundSource has an extensive repository of wound care products reviewed by an editorial board and hence, provides a good overview on the list of commercially available products in wound assessment and monitoring. Our results included a mixture of studies examining on DFUs specifically and chronic wounds in general. Majority of the included articles were also centred around wound assessment and accuracy, with only one article on data capturing and information storage. In addition, we were only able to provide a descriptive analysis of the studies as the studies varied in intervention and outcome measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">| CONCLUSION</head><p>This review identified the various modalities of wound assessment and monitoring in diabetic foot ulcers including computer software, hand-held and mobile devices, optical imaging, spectroscopy, and artificial intelligence. Rapid advancement in technology has resulted in the development of various types of wound assessment and monitoring systems which serve as useful adjuncts in improving clinical care, with various products documenting superior accuracy over traditional methods of wound assessments. In line with this, it is prudent to have ongoing studies to evaluate the evidence and outcomes of the extensive list of commercially available wound assessment and monitoring systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Summary of use of various modalities in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) Summary of the use of artificial intelligence for wound assessment or monitoring in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)</figDesc><table><row><cell>T A B L E 1 (Continued) T A B L E 1 (Continued)</cell><cell>Modality Author (year) Name of System n Wound Type Comparator Objective Parameters Assessed Measurement Statistics Integration Advantages Challenges Modality Author (year) Name of System n Wound Type Comparator Objective Parameters Assessed Measurement Statistics Integration Advantages Challenges Modality Author (year) Name of System n Wound Type Comparator Objective Parameters Assessed Measurement Statistics Integration Advantages Challenges Author (year) -Computer Jeffcoate ImageJ (National 31 Chronic ulcers No control Measurement of cross-2D: cross-sectional area Inter-rater reliability: -Easy training and Unable to measure 3D Normal foot: foot compared to alterations in Neidrauer et al (2010) 23 software or et al (2017) 18 Institutes of Health) sectional area of Correlation between observers relatively inexpensive images Intra-operator reliability high: normal foot, ensuring software Near-infrared spectroscopy 16 DFU NA Efficacy of using diffuse near infrared Oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin At 10 weeks: 3 μm/week threshold, 5/6 Allows trending of results by graph plotting -Type of AI n Wound Type Clinical Use Measurement Clinical Use/Study EHR or EMR Clinical Use/Study EHR or EMR Clinical Use/Study EHR or EMR Accuracy Goyal et al (2020) 11 Faster R-CNN with 1459 DFU Recognition of Average accuracy of all Remote Assessment Capabilities Eventually transit into Challenges Substantial datasets</cell><cell>hand-held digital images &gt;0.99 (P = 0.000).
