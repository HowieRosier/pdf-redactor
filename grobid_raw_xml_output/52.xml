<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Wound care is an essential field of healthcare that involves the proper management and treatment of wounds to promote complete and timely healing and prevent complications that may lead to amputation, infection, and other potentially life-threatening outcomes. Traditionally, wound care has involved standard protocols, often relying on primary dressings and routine procedures. In recent years, innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), have revolutionized wound care, providing more effective and efficient solutions for acute and chronic injuries.</p><p>The exact definition of AI remains a point of ongoing discussion. The term, created by John McCarthy in 1955, refers to the creation of computer systems able to perform tasks and solve problems that usually require human intelligence, such as image recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It can be broadly defined as the incorporation of human intelligence into machines.</p><p>With the integration of AI-based technologies in daily life, applying such technologies will be indispensable for every organization. AI stands out as a highly promising technology Nurs. Rep. 2024, 14 628 within the healthcare sector. There is great optimism that these technologies have the potential to provide significant improvements in all healthcare domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Several AI functionalities are applied in the health sector, such as decision-making support, patient monitoring, early diagnosis, workflow improvement, information sharing, security, remote surgery, virtual patients, and virtual assistants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, AI has significantly transformed the training and education of professional healthcare personnel, offering numerous benefits. AI in education includes intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots, robots, and automated assessment tools integrated into digitized materials that improve education <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These advancements provide students with personalized, efficient, and immersive learning experiences, enhancing teachers' understanding of students' learning processes and enabling machine-supported queries at any time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>A significant feature of incorporating AI into medical education is its adaptive learning ability to analyze and offer instant feedback and assessment, allowing students to monitor their knowledge gaps, recognize weaknesses, and receive immediate guidance for improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. AI has the capability to tailor the learning experience based on each student's individual needs, knowledge level, and preferred learning style, ensuring the delivery of relevant and efficient educational materials <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Educators can also gain advantages from analytics generated by AI, which offer assistance in recognizing trends and patterns in student performance, adapting teaching approaches as needed, and enhancing the overall learning experience. This can contribute to enhanced working efficiency and teaching competence.</p><p>Generative AI is defined as a form or subset of AI that uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to create new data. A crucial element of generative AI is the capability of understanding potential data distributions and producing new data that mirror the original set. This technology diverges from traditional AI tasks like classification or regression, as it is capable of autonomously generating new content, including images and text. Its applications extend to different areas; in image generation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are often used, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and transformer networks are employed in natural language processing to produce novel textual content. This technology is also recognized for its potential to transform medical education <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>The application of AI in education has drawn worldwide interest across numerous areas of healthcare professional education. Physicians and nurses have increasingly incorporated AI technology to enrich students' learning experiences with more realistic, sophisticated, complex, and immersive simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This enables students and healthcare professionals to refine their clinical skills within a secure and controlled learning environment <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. The potential of generative AI in medical education can significantly enhance wound care training and practice. It offers innovative methods for personalized learning, cased-based learning and simulation-based training, continuous education, and research assistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the various benefits and the potential of AI in medical education, some areas still require further investigation. These include clarifying the long-term implications of AI-driven learning methodologies for student performance, instructor-student interactions, and the ethical implications of AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Despite ongoing improvements in the wound care field, AI provides valuable contributions to early detection, risk factor analysis, risk stratification, prediction, diagnosis, intelligent treatment, outcome prediction, and prognosis evaluation <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. From innovative dressings embedded with sensors to advanced imaging techniques, this technology is improving the healing process and supplying healthcare professionals with real-time data for decision-making support and predictive risk assessment related to wounds. This technology is transforming wound care from prevention to treatment, and wound care must adjust to this changing world to improve patient care <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">26]</ref>.</p><p>Treating wounds is often a significant challenge for healthcare professionals, as the multitude of treatment criteria, care products, patient conditions, and responses complicate the healing process and results. To maximize patient outcomes in wound care, it is recommended that those involved possess the appropriate knowledge and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Wound care education contributes significantly to patient well-being and healthcare efficiency.</p><p>While specific studies directly addressing the role of AI in wound care education are limited, emerging technologies are making significant progress in this area. For instance, the use of metaverse technology, including virtual reality (VR) simulations, provides immersive learning and training experiences that closely resemble real-life surgical scenarios, while also being more efficient in the use of resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Another advancement is the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) with machine learning (ML) algorithms, which facilitates real-time interventions and diagnostic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. These developments in medical education highlight the growing integration of AI technologies, offering students realistic and immersive scenarios, especially in surgical fields, and this approach can be extended to wound care education <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. The potential of combining these technologies with machine learning and AI indicates a promising future for more effective, personalized, and interactive learning experiences in healthcare education.</p><p>Using generative AI to create personalized quizzes or images of detailed and varied different wound types would enhance personalized and case-based learning, allowing students to diagnose and plan treatment for a wide range of wound conditions, and learning materials and feedback can be tailored specifically to wound care <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This approach would allow educators to address individual students' strengths and weaknesses in wound care techniques, pathology, and patient management, for example.</p><p>The challenge lies in ensuring the academic integrity and validity of AI-generated research <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The impact on scholarly communication is profound, as it necessitates new methods for peer review and verification to maintain the credibility of the scientific process <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This emerging scenario presents both opportunities and challenges for academic communities.</p><p>In 1947, Alan Turing, a pioneering figure in computer science, delivered one of the earliest public lectures about computer intelligence, saying "What we want is a machine that can learn from experience" and the "possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this". Integrating AI literacy into medical education curricula and rethinking assessment methods considering AI's capabilities are essential for the rapid evolution of AI.</p><p>A preliminary search in the CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO, and Open Science Framework (OSF) databases indicates that, at present, there are no published or ongoing scoping reviews or systematic reviews concerning the use of AI in wound care education. The literature refers to a considerable number of AI applications for wound care. However, the integration of AI into wound care education remains uncertain. Thus, the authors conducted a scoping review to map and analyze the existing scientific literature on the potential impact of AI in wound care education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>Given the limited knowledge about AI applications in wound care education and the emerging nature of this topic, a scoping review approach was determined to be the most appropriate method, given its purpose in mapping the evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. In addition, it emerged as the starting point for subsequent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Given their exploratory nature, scoping reviews are particularly useful when the goal is to map the existing literature on a broad topic, identify key concepts, and provide an overview of the available evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, unlike systematic reviews, scoping reviews provide greater flexibility in study selection, enabling a more expansive exploration of the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. This adaptability proves especially valuable in emerging fields with evolving evidence, where research questions may be less defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. It aids researchers in understanding the current knowledge landscape, clarifying concepts, and shaping future research directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>This exploratory approach makes them valuable for gaining a comprehensive understanding and mapping out this research area. This mapping can provide a detailed description of the available information on AI applications in wound care education, identifying possible gaps in knowledge, offering conclusions about the current state of research activity in this area, and making recommendations for future research.</p><p>This review protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MTGDX, accessed on 30 November 2023).</p><p>The scoping review follows the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> and the Guidance for Conducting Systematic Scoping Reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Results will be presented following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> guidelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Research Questions</head><p>It is suggested that scoping review questions should have a broad scope <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. This involves delineating the concept, specifying the target population, and identifying health outcomes of interest to bring clarity to the scoping study's focus and develop a robust search strategy <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. The research questions were formulated through collaborative discussions with the research team and relevant stakeholders. A panel of experts, including advanced practice nurses, nurse researchers, and educators in the fields of digital health technologies and health education, were consulted to shape the research questions aligning with the objective of this review.</p><p>To achieve this study's aims, the following research question was identified according to JBI recommendations in the PCC mnemonic guide: what evidence currently exists regarding the application of AI in wound care education?</p><p>Additionally, this review aims to answer the following sub-questions:</p><p>• How is AI integrated into wound care education?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>How is AI being used to educate healthcare students about wound assessment and management?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>How does AI contribute to the education of healthcare professionals in wound assessment and management, particularly in clinical and academic settings? • What evidence currently exists regarding the use of machine learning and simulation technologies in AI-driven wound care education? • What evidence currently exists regarding the application of AI in formal wound care educational programs and training? • What are the benefits of AI application in wound care education for healthcare practi- tioners, students, and educators? • What experiences and perceptions do healthcare practitioners, students, and educators have regarding AI in wound care education?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>What learning outcomes result from integrating AI technology in wound care education?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>What are the barriers to and facilitators of applying AI technology in wound care education?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Inclusion Criteria</head><p>To determine the main subjects under investigation and formulate the eligibility criteria, the PCC (Population, Concept, Context) framework was used:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Participants: this study will encompass all literature that discussed participants as healthcare practitioners, students, and educators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Concept: this review will include literature that analyzes AI and its influence on wound care education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Context: education. To expand the scope of the review, the context will be broad and involve any educational settings without geographic restrictions.</p><p>The scope of the literature reviewed will include any quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies. Additionally, gray literature (conference abstracts, theses, government reports, clinical practice guidelines, editorial and opinion papers) will be included as well. Provided they meet the eligibility criteria, this analysis may also include additional relevant manuscripts. Studies that do not explore AI in wound care education will be excluded.</p><p>Literature sources were limited to English, Portuguese, and Spanish, based on the authors' language proficiency, without imposing geographical or cultural restrictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Search Strategy</head><p>We used the PCC method and field knowledge to identify relevant keywords concerning this topic. As recommended by JBI scoping review methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, we performed preliminary research using keywords (artificial intelligence, wound, and education) on two databases relevant to the topic of interest: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE via PubMed) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL via EBSCOhost). The titles, abstracts, and index terms of the identified studies were reviewed to extract the MeSH thesaurus and CINAHL Subject Headings used to describe the literature. Subsequently, in collaboration with a health sciences librarian, two reviewers developed the search strategy, which was peer-reviewed by the third expert reviewer based on the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The MEDLINE (via Pubmed) search strategy can be found in Appendix A. The search strategy, including all identified keywords and index terms, was customized for each literature source. When available, subject headings such as MeSH and Emtree terms were used.</p><p>As experts in the development of scoping review protocols, team members reviewed the search terms, Boolean operators, and results to edit and enhance the search strategy.</p><p>Article reference lists were sourced for additional articles. This step aims to check for additional studies not previously identified. Establishing contact with the authors of the identified studies might be useful for potential clarifications or obtaining references.</p><p>The whole search was carried out in the following databases: CINAHL Complete (via EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, Academic Search Complete, Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo), Scopus, and Web of Science. Electronic searches were also conducted in the Scientific Open Access Scientific Repositories of Portugal (RCAAP) and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, OpenAIRE, and Open Dissertations databases to access gray literature. Additionally, searches were performed on Google Scholar and specific journals such as the International Wound Journal, Skin Research and Technology, Journal of Wound Care, and Wound Repair and Regeneration. The selection of these databases was performed in collaboration with the health sciences librarian to guarantee comprehensive coverage of the key concepts (artificial intelligence, wounds, and education).</p><p>The searches were carried out on 1 December 2023, and all results were imported into Endnote vX20 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Duplicated studies were subsequently removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Evidence Screening and Study Selection</head><p>In the first phase, article titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers for eligibility criteria using the Rayyan QCR platform. In the second phase, potentially relevant records were obtained in full through institutional access or by emailing authors. The full text of potentially relevant evidence was screened according to the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers.</p><p>To systematize the review and minimize research bias, two independent reviewers were involved in each selection phase.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>As the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges, the use of AI in medical education presents a paradigm shift, offering unprecedented personalization and decisionmaking enhancements <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>. However, it also brings ethical dilemmas, such as ensuring patient privacy, fairness in AI-driven decisions, and legal accountability <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>.</p><p>The WHO document on AI in health outlines several advantages and ethical pitfalls of AI in medical education. Some advantages are related to Enhanced Management and Diagnostics: AI aids in managing complex cases and streamlining routine diagnoses, enhancing the educational process with practical applications; Reduced Administrative Burden: AI reduces the workload on healthcare providers by handling clerical tasks, allowing more focus on education; Novel Insights from Data: AI provides new insights from health data, enriching educational content with advanced knowledge; and Support in Education and Research: AI tools support medical and nursing education and research, improving the understanding of medical conditions <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Despite this, we have as Potential Ethical Pitfalls the Quality of Education: AI inaccuracies could negatively impact medical education quality; the Additional Burden on Healthcare Workers: AI integration may require additional training for healthcare professionals not yet skilled in digital technologies; Bias and Privacy Concerns: AI in education raises issues of bias, privacy breaches, and accessibility, necessitating fairness and data protection; and Skills Degradation and Moral De-skilling: over-reliance on AI might erode clinicians' skills and confidence in making independent decisions and moral judgments <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>.</p><p>As emphasized by Drabiak et al., while AI and machine learning bring significant promise to education, particularly in personalizing learning experiences and enhancing educational efficiency, they also raise critical ethical concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. These concerns include issues related to data privacy, the responsibility of AI decision-making, trustworthiness of AI systems, and ensuring fairness in educational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. This perspective highlights the need for a balanced approach in AI implementation, ensuring that the technological advancements contribute positively to the educational landscape while conscientiously addressing ethical implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Incorporating AI into wound care education demands careful consideration of ethical aspects. The effectiveness of AI is also deeply influenced by the quality of the data it processes. For wound care education, it is essential to use high-quality, diverse, and representative data to avoid biases in AI algorithms. These biases can arise from both the data and human input, potentially distorting educational outcomes. Consequently, special attention to data selection and algorithm design is crucial for equitable and accurate educational experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, ethical aspects of AI, such as interpretability, accountability, and bias, are critical and need to be addressed carefully. Recent research has identified a need for better understandability of machine learning algorithms and predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. This includes clarifying AI's role in decision-making, advocating for transparency, reducing algorithmic bias, and enhancing trust among stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>The integration of AI in wound care education should be ruled by robust ethical oversight. This involves establishing committees for the ethical review of AI applications, ensuring alignment with ethical principles, and respecting learner rights. Continuous assessment of the risks and benefits of AI in education is vital for maintaining integrity and trustworthiness.</p><p>Balancing the benefits of data sharing with the protection of individual privacy is a critical ethical challenge. Rigorous data security measures and transparent data usage tracking mechanisms are elemental. This approach helps maintain trust while leveraging AI's educational advantages.</p><p>Transparency in AI operations and decision-making processes is also crucial in education. On the practical side, the implementation of AI faces technical and pedagogical hurdles. The cross-disciplinary nature of AI necessitates joint consideration of technical and legal aspects, especially in sensitive areas such as data cleaning in medical AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Instructors' technological skills are instrumental but not sufficient for integrating AI in classrooms, further complicating the issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>By addressing these ethical considerations, AI can be used in wound care education effectively, while also being ethically rigorous and responsible <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This approach enhances the educational experience while safeguarding the interests and rights of all involved stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Limitations</head><p>We acknowledge potential limitations of the scoping review, particularly its restriction to studies published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. However, no studies will be excluded based on country. Potentially relevant studies will be listed in a supplement of the final review.</p><p>The inclusion of diverse sources, with various study designs, may challenge the validity of the results. Variability in how AI and wound care education are defined and measured across studies may also affect construct validity.</p><p>While scoping reviews typically do not appraise the quality of included articles, and explicit reasons for not conducting such appraisals in this review are provided, this is acknowledged as another potential limitation of the scoping review. The lack of critical appraisal may limit the scoping review's ability to provide concrete recommendations for practice or policy, as the quality of the included studies is not systematically evaluated. Despite these limitations, given that scoping reviews are considered a precursor to a systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, critical appraisal could be implemented if the conditions for conducting a systematic review are met.</p><p>Scoping reviews aim to offer a comprehensive overview rather than specific recommendations, limiting the ability to draw detailed conclusions and generalize findings. The applicability of results to various educational settings or populations might be constrained by the specific focus on AI in wound care education. Additionally, findings may not be directly transferable to different healthcare systems, educational institutions, or regions with distinct practices and resources.</p><p>We will consider the impact of these limitations and address any additional limitations that may arise when reporting our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>AI plays a significant role in the future of healthcare education. Therefore, embracing AI and related technologies is not merely an option but a transformative trend that organizations must acknowledge and leverage for competitive advantage. While AI tools have been employed to assess wound care, efforts are needed to enhance their potential impact on wound care education. Integrating AI into health education, specifically wound care, represents a paradigm shift in how educational content is delivered and processed. This transformation goes beyond traditional methods to provide a more personalized, efficient, and interactive learning experience. AI-driven tools can adapt to individual learning styles and provide tailored teaching materials and simulations. This adaptability improves the learning process, making it more engaging and efficient for students and professionals alike. With AI's ability to analyze and interpret complex medical data, students and physicians can gain insights into wound care from remote locations, breaking down geographic barriers in education. This is especially important in the current global situation, where distance learning and telemedicine are becoming increasingly important. We hope that integrating AI into wound care education will not only revolutionize the delivery of knowledge but also directly improve patient outcomes. By more effectively training healthcare professionals in wound care, AI can help better diagnose, treat, and manage wounds, ultimately improving the quality of patient care. This is consistent with the broader goals of health education, which focus on improving health outcomes and the standards of patient care.</p><p>As this scoping review will illustrate, harnessing the potential of AI in wound care education requires not only a thorough understanding of its capabilities but also a commitment to addressing the ethical and practical challenges associated with its implementation. A careful exploration of the ethical aspects surrounding artificial intelligence in wound care education is essential. As AI shapes the educational landscape, addressing issues like data privacy and bias is crucial for a responsible integration that ensures both educational excellence and ethical approval.</p><p>As far as we know, this is the first review to explore the influence of AI in the context of wound care education. The findings of this scoping review will likely provide insights into the application of AI in wound care education, identify research gaps in the literature, and promote further research initiatives. Hopefully, it will also be relevant for educators, students, policymakers, health and education organizations, and researchers in healthcare sciences and engineering.</p><p>The results will be disseminated through presentations at health education meetings and conferences and publication in a peer-reviewed health education journal. of data, the writing of this article or the decision to submit it for publication.
